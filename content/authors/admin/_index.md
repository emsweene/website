# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am an Assistant Professor in the Biostatistics Division in the Population Health Sciences Department at Weill Cornell Medicine. My main area of expertise is working on the statistical analysis of structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data, with a focus on the disease area of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The problems I have worked on span many areas, including image segmentation, image normalization and harmonization, cross-sectional and longitudinal modeling, as well as software development. The statistical techniques used to solve these problems include classification, machine learning, longitudinal data analysis, and functional data analysis techniques. In addition, I am an avid R enthusiast! I am currently an associate editor for the R Journal (https://journal.r-project.org/) and served on the board of the meetup group [R Ladies NYC](http://www.rladiesnyc.org/). A video of my 2019 NYR talk on doing neuroimaging analysis in R can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HkEq01nrco). I also co-taught a Coursera course on neuroimaging analysis using R called [Introduction to Neurohacking in R](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neurohacking).
