title: "Introduction to Neurohacking in R"
summary: "Neurohacking describes how to use the R programming language and its associated packages to perform manipulation, processing, and analysis of neuroimaging data. We focus on publicly-available structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) datasets. We discuss concepts such as inhomogeneity correction, image registration, and image visualization. The course is ongoing on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neurohacking)."
