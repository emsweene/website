title: "Longitudinal Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Behavior"
summary: "Brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a tool that uses a magnetic field to produce detailed images of the brain. Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have lesions in their brains which are visible on sMRI. MS lesions formation is a complex process involving inflammation, tissue damage, and tissue repair â€” all of which are visible on sMRI and potentially modifiable by pharmacological therapy. We developed a piepline to extract longitudinal information from MS lesions in multisequence sMRI.  We then developed a biomarker of lesion repair and explored the biomarker's association to clinical information, such as the use of steroids and disease-modifying treatment ([publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158215300139)).
