title: "Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping"
summary: "In collaboration with [Susan Gauthier](https://vivo.weill.cornell.edu/display/cwid-sag2015), [Thanh Nguyen](https://vivo.weill.cornell.edu/display/cwid-tdn2001), [Yi Wang](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/yi-wang), and [Sandra Hurtado Rua](http://facultyprofile.csuohio.edu/csufacultyprofile/detail.cfm?FacultyID=s_hurtadorua) we are working on methods to analyze the behavior of multiple sclerosis lesions on a structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) sequence called the quantitative susceptibility map (QSM).  QSM is a new sMRI technique that provides in-vivo quantification of magnetic susceptibility changes related to iron deposition. We are interested in a subtype of lesion with chronic inflammation, which we call QSM rim+ lesion.   QSM rim+ lesion have a distinct longitudinal pattern consistent with retained inflammation followed by a transition to a chronic inactive state.  Weare actively working to understand how demographic features and treatment impact the longitudinal behavior of these lesions."
