title: "Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Age Estimation"
summary: "When a multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion is detected in the brain using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) it is often unknown how old this lesion is. Information about the age of an MS lesion is crucial for analyzing longitudinal lesion information as well as for diagnosing the disease.  We developed methodology to estimate the age of an MS lesion from cross-sectional multisequence sMRI studies using lesion radiomic features (histogram based, shape based, and texture based features) ([publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920309368)). Currently, we are expanding upon this work to utilize longitudinal information from MS lesions for more accurate age estimation.  We are implementing functional data analysis (fda) techniques to register multisequence longitudinal curves from MS lesion to estimate this age."
