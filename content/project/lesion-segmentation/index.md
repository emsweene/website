title: "Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation"
summary: "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to detect lesions in the brains of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and is essential for diagnosing the disease and monitoring its progression. In practice, lesion load is often quantified by either manual or semi-automated segmentation of MRI, which is time-consuming, costly, and associated with large inter- and intra-observer variability.  We developed the method OASIS for automated lesion segmentation at a single time point ([publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158213000235#f0005)) and SuBLIME for segmentation of incident MS lesions ([publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158213000235#f0005)).  We also performed a comparison of different machine learning algorithm for the problem of MS lesion segmentation ([publication](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095753)). More recently we have turned our attention to identifying a particular subtype of lesion, called a chronic active MS lesions, which has ongoing inflammation at the edges of the lesion.  These lesions are of interest because they have the potential to serve as a biomarker in MS and may even help to evaluate disease-modifying treatments. These lesions are characterized by a hyperintense rim on an MRI sequence called quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and a hypointense rim on phase imaging.  We have worked on methods to identify these lesions on both phase ([publication](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.276238v1)) and QSM imaging."
